## ⚡ Core Protocol Manifest

### 1. High-Fidelity Visualizers
Interact with 16+ specialized environments, each optimized for specific mental models:
- **Trees & Graphs:** Binary Search Trees, AVL Trees, Segment Trees, Tries, and Graph Traversal (BFS/DFS/Dijkstra).
- **Linear Structures:** Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues (Simple, Circular, Priority).
- **Advanced Mechanics:** Dynamic Programming (LCS, Knapsack), Matrix Operations, and Convex Hull (Graham Scan/Jarvis March).
- **Search & Sort:** Comparative Sorting Race Mode and Logarithmic Binary Search.


### 2. Step-by-Step Execution
Complete control over the algorithmic timeline:
- **Playback Controls:** Pause, rewind, or step-frame through execution.
- **Variable Speed:** Adjust the "Hertz Rate" from 0.5x to 20x speed.
- **Visual Diagnostics:** Live tracking of space complexity and pointer movement.

### 3. Polyglot Documentation
A built-in neural index providing implementation syntax in:
- **Python, Java, C++, and C.**
- Time and Space complexity breakdowns for every operation.

## 🎨 Visual Identity: "Cyber-Grid 2025"
The application uses a custom-themed cyberpunk aesthetic:
- **Primary Cyan (`#00f5ff`):** Represents active neural processes and valid nodes.
- **Deep Black (`#0a0a0a`):** Minimizes eye strain during long study sessions.
- **Holographic Glass:** Containers utilize heavy backdrop-blur and border-glows for depth.
